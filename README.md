The main aim of this front-end-only project is to explore VueJS and its functionalities.

The application follows the component architecture and the Single-Page Web Application concept.

This To-Do List Application can add new To-Dos, strike-through on completion and delete existing To-Dos.

A basic vue-router functionality is added to demonstrate.

The application makes GET, POST and DELETE http requests to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos which is an online tool which fakes backend http requests with dummy data for learning purposes.
